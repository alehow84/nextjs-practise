## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is a Next.js practise project where I have explored some of the main features of Next.js and some web development best practises, including optimising Accessibility, Metadata and Security.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

The bulk of the code was already provided, though through the course I have covered:
- Adding CSS styling with Tailwind, CSS Modules and adding conditional classnames with clsx
- Optimising fonts and images to improve the web-app performance
- Adding Routes using file-system routing and created nested layouts
- Adding Navigation
- Setting up the database, fetching data and data streaming
- The pros & cons of static vs dynamic rendering
- Adding Search and Pagination
- Mutating data with React Server Actions & elegant error-handling
- Improving Accessibility with ESlint accessibility plugin
